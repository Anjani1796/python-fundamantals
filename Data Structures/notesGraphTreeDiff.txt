Difference between graph and tree:

• A tree can be described as a specialized case of graph with no self loops and circuits.

• There are no loops in a tree whereas a graph can have loops.

• There are three sets in a graph i.e. edges, vertices and a set that represents their relation while a tree consists of nodes that are connected to each other. These connections are referred to as edges.

• In tree there are numerous rules spelling out how connections of nodes can occur whereas graph has no rules dictating the connection among the nodes.
